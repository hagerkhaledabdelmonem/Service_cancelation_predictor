# Service_cancelation_predictor
Service cancellation is simply when customers leave doing business with an entity.
It involves determining the possibility of customers stopping doing business with an entity. In other words, if a consumer has purchased a subscription to a particular service, we must determine the likelihood that the customer would leave or cancel the membership. It is a critical prediction for many businesses because acquiring new clients often costs more than retaining existing ones. For many businesses, the ability to predict that a particular customer is at a high risk of canceling service, while there is still time to do something about it. Whereas the company will try to offer some extra functionalities for not leaving the service.

### Main Steps:
  1. You need first to apply some preprocessing on the data to make sure that it is ready to use it.
     Preprocessing phase includes handling unwanted features, checking if data types of columns are correct, null values, categorical values, and data scaling
  2. Choose the best technique to predict the service cancellation with a high accuracy.
     You must prove by code that the chosen algorithm produces a higher accuracy than some of the other algorithms. 
     try to use logistic regression, SVM, and Decision Tree ID3.


### Deliverables:
An application with a simple GUI " tkinter library " that accepts input classification method and the accuracy of the used classification method. Also, the gui can accept data of a customer and predict if he\she may cancel the subscription
